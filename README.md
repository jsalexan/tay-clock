  ## Description
  A work in progress, this is a Taylor Swift concert countdown app. On the landing page, select the concert date you're attending, then a new page loads with a countdown to the concert day. 
  <br>

  For my application, I used the following technologies: CSS, JavaScript, HTML, GitHub Pages, Spotify API, and Git.
  <br>
 
  Up next, exploring converting it into a widget. I'll also add more dates as they come up, particularly those for the 2nd leg of the US.
  Last, I'd like to add something more interesting to appear on your concert day.
